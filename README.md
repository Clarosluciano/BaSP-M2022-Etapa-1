# 7th week Exercise

## Brief description:
For this task, teachers asked us to make the "request" part of the sign up page and the login page diagramed in the first week. This week's rubric consisted of understanding and applying the logic that is used to make "request" to the APIs and receive a satisfactory or erroneous response depending on each case.
