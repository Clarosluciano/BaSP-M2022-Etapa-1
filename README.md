# 2nd week Exercise

## Brief description:
For this task, teachers asked us to make a HTMLdoc that replicates the landing page that we made last week. Jps images and icons that were created in Figma and implemented last week can be used for this exercise.

## Steps for running the HTMLdoc:

1- Copy this link in your browser: https://github.com/Clarosluciano/BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1

2- Click on the green "Code" button.

3- Click on "Download ZIP".

4- Open it and extract the files.

5- Open "index.html".
